# *Netflix Content Analysis: Exploring Trends, Genres, and Viewer Insights with Python*  
*Project Overview*  

---

## *Problem Statement*  
Netflix’s vast library of movies and TV shows holds hidden patterns about content creation, audience preferences, and global trends. However, raw data alone cannot answer critical questions like:  
- How has Netflix’s content strategy evolved over the years?  
- Which genres or countries dominate the platform?  
- What insights can guide content creators or marketers?  

This project solves these challenges by analyzing Netflix’s dataset using *Python* to extract actionable insights through *data visualization, **statistical analysis, and **trend identification*.
